# Website of Christina Vafaian

### About
Hello and welcome to the repository for my personal webpage! I made this as both a passion project and as an interesting way to introduce myself to people I meet in the future. The website is made using a combination of React, HTML, CSS, and React-Bootstrap. It is currently still under construction, so look out for the completed version coming soon!
