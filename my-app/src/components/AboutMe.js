			<b> About Me </b>

			<br></br>
			<p>
				I graduated December 2020 from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
				I am currently seeking a full time position leaning towards software development in Michigan, US.
			</p>
			<p>
				I most enjoy the experience of developing projects from end-to-end and getting the opportunity to learn something new while I am at it!
				I especially appreciate thoughtful design which results in easy to understand code and user friendly interfaces.
			</p>
			<p> The main object oriented languages I use and am familiar with is Python and C++, but I am always interested in learning more! </p>
			<p> If any of this sounds interesting to you, please do connect with me using any of the social media platforms below! </p>
