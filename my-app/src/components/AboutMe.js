			<b> About Me </b>

			<br></br>

			<p> I am a Senior at the University of Michigan. At the moment I'm pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and plan to graduate by December 2020.</p>
			<p> I am creative and enjoy making an impact in the things I do. I believe this drive is expressed through my passion for web and software development. I enjoy thoughtful design which not only looks good but that is user friendly.</p>
			<p> The main languages I use are Python and C++, but I am always interested in learning more! </p>
			<p> Currently I am seeking full time employment. </p>
