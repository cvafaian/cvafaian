			<b> My Experience </b>

			<br></br>

			<p> I have experience in developing programs from small solo projects all the way up to 5 member team projects.</p>
			<p> Most projects I've done are in C++, Python, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I also have some experience doing projects with databases such as MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB (lesser). </p>

			<p> Currently I am in the middle of rediscovering myself as a professional developer. During my time at university, I got the opportunity to code personal mini projects all the way to large scale, year long projects. However, only when I completed my first open-source contribution did I realize that software development is much more than just coding. </p>
			<p> Software development to me is reading, presenting, collaborating, testing, and more. Thanks to my enrollment in the Literature</p>
