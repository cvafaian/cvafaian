			<b> My Experience </b>

			<br></br>

			<p> I have completed small solo projects all the way up to 5 member team projects. Most projects I've done are in C++, Python, and JavaScript. However, I do have some experience doing projects with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB (lesser). </p>

			<p> Currently I am a Student Software Engineer for Bosch through the University of Michigan's Multidisciplinary Design Program.</p>
			<p> Through this experience, I have gotten the opportunity to integrate an end to end platform for internal Bosch personnel. Through computer vision and machine learning our platform is able to detect cut-in/cut-outs of vehicles. With this, the platform can be used as a tool to replace hours of tedious manual tagging by Bosch interns.</p>

			<p> Additionally, I am currently a Student Grader for EECS 493. This is a class I had taken this past Winter 2020 semester and greatly enjoyed. I really value the learning opportunity I've been given. Through this position, I am able to see how my fellow peers design and think about code along with the thought and care that instructors put into facilitating education when teaching.</p>
